## Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AIP.-->
An AIP (Agora Improving Proposal) is a design document proposed to the Agora community in terms of, but not limited to, a new feature, a new initiative, and a piece of preach. The AIP should provide a concise specification and a rationale for the feature or other types of proposal. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and implementing together with the teams.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Agora is the organization supreme to its entity and concept. AIP is the inborn preach to the Agora community. We encourage the community to submit AIPs with a templated format and follow up with the ongoing procedures in time, and implement the approved AIP on time in a planned way.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Agora platforms.-->
We'd specify the AIP Guidelines step by step:
1. Read the [README.md](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs/blob/master/README.md) and this [initial AIP](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs/blob/master/AIP-1/aip-1.md) to understand the whole process and guidelines.
2. Study the previous [AIPs](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs) to check availabilities and redundancies.
3. Fork the [AIPs repo](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs).
4. Draft your AIP using the [AIP template](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs/blob/master/aip-template.md).
5. Submit your AIP via the Pull Request to the [AIPs repo](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs).
6. Communicate with the community under your Pull Request in time for further proceeding and follow-ups.
7. Contact the responding team for implementation and project management.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.-->
Collaboration is at the core of AIP proceeding in the open source Agora community.

## Implementation
<!--The implementation must be completed before any AIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the AIP is accepted.-->
A project management proposal is preferred to be attached here.
