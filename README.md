# Agora Improving Proposals (AIPs)

The Agora Improving Proposals (AIPs) provide design documents to describe new features, new initiatives and new inspirations for the Agora platforms and community.

## Contributing

1. Review the [AIP-1](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs/blob/master/AIP-1/aip-1.md).
2. Fork the Agora's [AIPs repository](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs).
3. Draft your AIP using the [AIP template](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs/blob/master/aip-template.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request to the Agora's [AIPs repository](https://github.com/agorahub/AIPs).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final AIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new AIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the AIP as a whole.

If your AIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that AIP as follows: assets/aip-N (where N is to be replaced with the AIP number). When linking to an image in the AIP, use relative links such as ../assets/aip-1/image.png.

Once your first PR is merged, we will help out merge PRs to draft AIPs. Make sure that you own the draft being edited and the 'author' line of your AIP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside. If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on your GitHub profile.
